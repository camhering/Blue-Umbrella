      <p class="my-class">From venue to violets, tables to tacos, and booze to banners - we've compiled all local vendors for you. Contracts are created with the click of a button, and all costs are upfront and transparent. Begin by indicating the number of people involved and follow the prompts until you feel you've covered everything. If you forget something, don't worry, you can always come back and make changes later - just make sure you pay attention to your cancellation timeline. That way no one gets fucked!</p>
